    "GNN에 관심을 가지게 된 계기는 [RoboGrammar](https://cdfg.mit.edu/publications/robogrammar-graph-grammar-for-terrain-optimized-robot-design)라는 [paper](https://cdfg.mit.edu/assets/files/robogrammar.pdf)였다. 예전부터 하고 싶었던 Robot design 아이디어를 GNN을 가지고 실현시킨 것이 너무 신기해서 공부해보고 싶었다. 이번 포스팅에서는 GNN과 첫만남인 만큼 공부할 자료들을 정리해보려 한다.\n",
